##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I read the breakdown suggestions listed here: http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/smacss/breakdown.html

I tried to make sense of it.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Nope. We probably should, but I feel like it's going unnecessarily complicate things. There's something about how we should use .l-header, for example. That's too much work.
